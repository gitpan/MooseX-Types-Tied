NAME
    MooseX::Types::Tied - Basic tied Moose types library

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of MooseX::Types::Tied - released
    April 21, 2012 as part of MooseX-Types-Tied.

SYNOPSIS
        use Moose;
        use MooseX::Types::Tied ':all';

DESCRIPTION
    This is a collection of basic Moose types for tied references. The

    specify the types you want imported explicitly or use the ':all'
    catchall.
